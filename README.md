# **IT3045C Final Project: Team Member Database**

## **Overview**
This project provides a structured way to manage data about team members and their related information, such as:
- **Breakfast habits**
- **Hobbies**
- **Pets**

The database consists of four main tables: `TeamMembers`, `BreakfastFood`, `Hobbies`, and `Pets`, with well-defined relationships that make querying and data manipulation efficient.
